# Python Server
## Description
A collaboration among groupmates while at Prime, we developed a simple server using Python and Flask.  This replaces the node.js and express back end we had used for a majority of our projects.  It uses psycopg2 to talk to the postgreSQL database.  This connects to the Pet Hotel Clientside repo. 


## Takeaways
This was a great opportunity to work closely with the group to explore a new language.  We were able to communicate and learn very quickly the steps we needed to take to get our app up and running in a relatively unfamiliar language.
